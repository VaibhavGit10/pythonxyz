# Introduction to GitHub

Welcome to your first GitHub project! GitHub is a powerful platform for version control and collaboration, allowing multiple people to work on projects simultaneously. Here are some key points to get you started:

1. **Version Control**: GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in your codebase. This helps in managing different versions of your project efficiently.

2. **Repositories**: A repository (or repo) is a project container that holds all your project files and the revision history. You can create a new repository on GitHub to start your project.

3. **Commits**: Changes to your project are saved in the form of commits. Each commit has a unique ID and a message describing the changes made.

4. **Branches**: Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes independently. The main branch is usually called `main` or `master`.

5. **Pull Requests**: When you are ready to merge your changes from a branch into the main branch, you create a pull request. This allows others to review your changes before they are merged.

6. **Collaboration**: GitHub makes it easy to collaborate with others. You can invite collaborators to your repository, review code, and discuss changes.

Happy coding!
